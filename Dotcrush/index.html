      <p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>What is Dot Crush?</h2>
          <p>Dot Crush is a fast-paced arcade game where players tap glowing dots to score points. Test your reflexes and compete on global and state-specific leaderboards!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How do I play?</h2>
          <p>Simply tap the glowing dots as they appear on screen. Each game lasts 30 seconds - try to score as many points as possible!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How does the leaderboard work?</h2>
          <p>We maintain both global and state-specific leaderboards. Your location is only used to place your score on the state leaderboard. You can view both leaderboards by tapping the trophy icon.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How do I remove ads?</h2>

        <li>
          <h2>Why was my name rejected?</h2>

        <li>
          <h2>How is my privacy protected?</h2>

            <h2>Pathsight FAQs:</h2>
            <p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h2>What is Pathsight?</h2>
                    <p>Pathsight is an AI-powered route planning and navigation assistance application that provides detailed, conversational directions and travel insights.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How do the subscriptions work?</h2>
                    <p>Pathsight offers different subscription tiers:
                       • Free tier includes 5 routes total
                       • Basic subscription ($3.99/month) includes 200 routes per month
                       • Pro subscription ($7.99/month) includes 500 routes per month</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How do I use the AI route planning?</h2>
                    <p>Simply enter your start and end points, and Pathsight will use AI to generate detailed route suggestions with natural language directions and travel insights.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Can I save my routes?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, premium subscribers can save their favorite routes and access them later in their route history.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Why might route suggestions vary?</h2>
                    <p>As an AI-powered service, route suggestions may vary slightly even for the same start and end points. This is normal and reflects the AI's ability to consider multiple factors and generate diverse recommendations. You can enable "Main route only" mode for more consistent results.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How accurate is the AI-generated content?</h2>
                    <p>While our AI (powered by Google's Gemini API) strives for accuracy, all suggestions should be used as guidance only. Always verify critical information, especially regarding road conditions, business hours, or travel restrictions. The AI provides helpful insights but should not be your sole source of navigation information. All AI-generated content must be clearly attributed as such when shared.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>What is "Main route only" mode?</h2>
                    <p>This is a faster mode that generates only the primary recommended route instead of multiple alternatives. It's useful when you want quick, straightforward directions without additional options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How current is the route information?</h2>
                    <p>The AI generates routes based on its training data and integrates with Apple Maps for navigation. While major roads and routes are generally accurate, always verify current conditions, especially for temporary closures or recent changes. Weather information is provided in real-time through OpenWeather API.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>What happens if the AI generation fails?</h2>
                    <p>In rare cases where route generation fails (due to network issues or service interruptions), the attempt won't count against your monthly route limit. You can simply try again. If problems persist, try enabling "Main route only" mode or contact support.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How is my privacy protected when using the AI features?</h2>
                    <p>While we use Google's Gemini API for route generation, we only share the minimum necessary information (such as start/end points and preferences). Your routes are stored securely in our system, but interactions with Google's Gemini API are subject to their privacy policy and data handling practices. We encourage you to review Google's AI privacy policy at ai.google.dev/terms for more information about how they handle data. We monitor API usage for abuse and may suspend access to users who violate Google's Acceptable Use Policy.</p>

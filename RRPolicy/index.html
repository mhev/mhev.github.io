      <h2>Resume Radar FAQs:</h2>
      <p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>What is Resume Radar?</h2>
          <p>Resume Radar is an AI-powered Chrome extension that analyzes your resume against job descriptions to help you get more interviews. It provides match scores, tailored suggestions for improvement, and AI-powered resume optimization.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How do the subscriptions work?</h2>
          <p>Resume Radar offers:
             ‚Ä¢ Free tier: Limited to 3 resume analyses per month
             ‚Ä¢ Pro subscription ($14.99): Full access to all features for 14 days</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How do I use Resume Radar?</h2>
          <p>Simply install the extension, navigate to a job posting, open the Resume Radar popup, and either paste your resume text or upload a PDF/DOCX file. The extension will automatically detect job descriptions on supported job sites and analyze your resume against them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Which job sites are supported?</h2>
          <p>Resume Radar currently supports LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, Dice, BuiltIn, Glassdoor, Monster, CareerBuilder, SimplyHired, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, SmartRecruiters, Jobvite, Wellfound, Y Combinator, Stack Overflow Jobs, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How accurate is the AI analysis?</h2>
          <p>Our AI uses Google Gemini Flash 2.0 to analyze the match between your resume and job descriptions. While it's highly effective at identifying relevant keywords and suggesting improvements, we are not responsible for what it may produce. The extension's objective is to help improve your resume, but we cannot promise interviews or employment as a result of using Resume Radar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I generate an optimized resume?</h2>
          <p>No, Resume Radar does not generate new resumes. The Pro version provides tailored suggestions to improve your existing resume based on the job description. You can view these recommendations and download them as a .txt file for reference.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How is my resume data stored and used?</h2>
          <p>We take your privacy seriously. Your resume and analysis results are stored securely in your browser's local storage and our secure cloud database. We do not sell or share your resume data with third parties. Resume data is only used to provide the analysis service and improve our algorithms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why might analysis results vary?</h2>
          <p>As an AI-powered service, analysis results may vary slightly for the same resume and job description. This is normal and reflects the AI's consideration of different factors during each analysis. For consistent results, you can save analyses for future reference.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What happens if the analysis fails?</h2>
          <p>In rare cases where analysis fails (due to network issues or service interruptions), the attempt won't count against your monthly limit. You can simply try again. If problems persist, try refreshing the page or contact support.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I use Resume Radar on multiple devices?</h2>
          <p>Yes, your Pro subscription is linked to your Google account. Simply log in with the same Google account on any device where you've installed Resume Radar, and your subscription will be automatically applied.</p>

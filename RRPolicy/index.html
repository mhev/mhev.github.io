        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How accurate is the AI analysis?</h2>
          <p>Our AI uses advanced language models to analyze the match between your resume and job descriptions. While it's highly effective at identifying relevant keywords and suggesting improvements, we recommend using it as a complementary tool to your own judgment and industry knowledge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I generate an optimized resume?</h2>
          <p>Yes, the Pro version allows you to generate a completely optimized version of your resume tailored to specific job descriptions. You can then download this as plain text, PDF, or DOCX.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How is my resume data stored and used?</h2>
          <p>We take your privacy seriously. Your resume and analysis results are stored securely in your browser's local storage and our secure cloud database. We do not sell or share your resume data with third parties. Resume data is only used to provide the analysis service and improve our algorithms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why might analysis results vary?</h2>
          <p>As an AI-powered service, analysis results may vary slightly for the same resume and job description. This is normal and reflects the AI's consideration of different factors during each analysis. For consistent results, you can save analyses for future reference.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What happens if the analysis fails?</h2>
          <p>In rare cases where analysis fails (due to network issues or service interruptions), the attempt won't count against your monthly limit. You can simply try again. If problems persist, try refreshing the page or contact support.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I use Resume Radar on multiple devices?</h2>

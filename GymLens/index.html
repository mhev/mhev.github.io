          <p>Simply take a photo of your workout equipment using the app's camera or select an image from your gallery. Then select your target muscle group and any injuries or limitations. GymLens will analyze the equipment and generate a personalized workout routine tailored to your needs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What equipment can GymLens recognize?</h2>
          <p>GymLens can identify a wide range of fitness equipment including dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, resistance bands, cable machines, weight machines, benches, pull-up bars, treadmills, exercise bikes, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How accurate are the workout suggestions?</h2>
          <p>While our AI strives for accuracy, all suggestions should be used as guidance only. The app analyzes the equipment in your photo and generates workouts based on established fitness principles. However, you should always exercise according to your personal fitness level and consult with a fitness professional if you have specific health concerns.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Can I save my workouts?</h2>
          <p>Yes, subscribers can save generated workouts for future reference and track their fitness progress over time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Why might workout suggestions vary?</h2>
          <p>As an AI-powered service, workout suggestions may vary even for the same equipment. This reflects the AI's ability to consider multiple exercises and generate diverse recommendations. This variety can help prevent workout plateaus and keep your fitness routine fresh.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>What if the app doesn't recognize my equipment correctly?</h2>
          <p>For best results, take clear photos with good lighting and try to include only the equipment you want to use in the frame. If recognition issues persist, you can manually specify equipment in the notes section when generating a workout.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>How is my privacy protected when using GymLens?</h2>

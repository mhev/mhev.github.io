            <p class="date">Last Updated: May 1st, 2025</p>

            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Hev LLC ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website or use our Pathsight navigation application (collectively, the "Service"). This policy explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            
            <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners and their service providers to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Hev LLC) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (such as advertising, interactive content, and analytics).</p>

            <h2>2. Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
            <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Service. Third parties serve cookies through our Service for analytics and other purposes.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Service and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>

            <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Service and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Service, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Service functions.</p>

            <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>

            <h2>4. How to Control Cookies</h2>
            
            <h3>4.1 Browser Settings</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>
            
            <h3>4.2 Do Not Track</h3>
            <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. This feature is not yet uniform across browsers, so we do not currently respond to such signals.</p>
            
            <h3>4.3 Mobile Application</h3>
            <p>Our Pathsight mobile application may also use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about how you use our application, in order to help us improve it, and to optimize the advertisements we show you. You can control these preferences within the app settings or via your device settings.</p>
